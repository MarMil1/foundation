# Stack Overflow VS-Code Extension README

## Features

StackOverflow IDE is a VS-Code extension that allows you to search for questions in StackOverflow and insert them directly into your code. You're able to paginate through questions, answers, copy and insert code, and favorite your questions. Light & Dark Mode is offered as well depending on your IDE preference. 

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[stackoverflow_ide_homepage\]\(images/stackoverflow_ide_homepage.png\)

\!\[stackoverflow_ide_homepage\]\(images/stackoverflow_ide_answers.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
